Todo:

Urgent:
- remove single game stopped working after one remove (BUG)
x autofill nickname with steam login name
x auto filter out single player games in lobby
- make option to manually mark as installed and not installed
x if we have no tags, and duplicate title, remove the game, mark it as dlc.
x pop out instead of slide out (when revealing removed pool). Start maximized?
x coophost sends all its games for comparison. Need to send only multiplayer since no single are allowed in lobby
- MORE logging
- make games editable in custom games
- change whole project to 'snowflake'

Non-urgent:
- Change networking to use MCF
