Todo:

Urgent:
- MORE logging
- change whole project to 'snowflake'
- check if custom game exe is a shortcut, if so get the target and use it instead

Non-urgent:
- change networking to use MCF
- make a "reset" for games tags
- remove single game stopped working after one remove (BUG)
- make steam games 'resetable' allow to reset to default for tags and name
- remember all ips entered, dropdown them when textbox is clicked, allow for deletion of ips too

Done:
x move custom and edit to a new window
x make games editable in custom games
x fix "No Tags" tag in custom game creation
x save settings on exit
x dont focus testboxes when first entering tab for custom and edit
x autofill nickname with steam login name
x auto filter out single player games in lobby
x if we have no tags, and duplicate title, remove the game, mark it as dlc.
x pop out instead of slide out (when revealing removed pool). Start maximized?
x coophost sends all its games for comparison. Need to send only multiplayer since no single are allowed in lobby
x display a message for offline and private, allow option to not show this message again.
x fix settings "refresh" currently it will try to refresh the first time snowflake loads and you open and accept options
x find a way to make host multiplayer pool either go through, or ignore custom games
x remove dead custom/edit code in settingsscreen
x add sounds to connect and disconnect for host (and maybe join?)
x make sure joined players cannot hit play
x verify hosting and custom games work together with the new multiplayer changes
x make edit game option to manually mark as installed and not installed
